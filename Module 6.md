# Module 6 - Layer 3 â€“ Session 2

### Q1. Capture and analyze ARP packets using Wireshark. Inspect the ARP request and reply frames when your device attempts to find the router's MAC address. Discuss the importance of ARP in packet forwarding.


### Q2. Manually configure static routes on a router to direct packets to different subnets. Use the ip route command and verify connectivity using ping and traceroute.


### Q3. Given a network address of 10.0.0.0/24, divide it into 4 equal subnets. Calculate the new subnet mask. Determine the valid host range for each subnet. Assign IP addresses to devices in Packet Tracer and verify connectivity.


### Q4. You are given three IP addresses: 192.168.10.5, 172.20.15.1, and 8.8.8.8. Identify the class of each IP address. Determine if it is private or public.Explain how NAT would handle a private IP when accessing the internet.

| IP ADDRESS | IP ADDRESS CLASS | TYPE OF IP |
| :---: | :---: | :---:|
| 192.168.10.5 | CLASS C | PRIVATE |
| 172.20.15.1 | CLASS B | PRIVATE |
| 8.8.8.8 | CLASS A | PUBLIC |


### Q5. In Cisco Packet Tracer, configure NAT on a router to allow internal devices (192.168.1.x) to access the internet. Test connectivity by pinging an external public IP. Capture the traffic in Wireshark and analyze the source IP before and after NAT translation.
